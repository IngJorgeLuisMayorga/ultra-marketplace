## About The Project
This project is an Angular application that acts as a simple app marketplace. It features a gallery of products that users can browse through and add to a cart. The cart section displays the total cost of the items selected for purchase. Users can then fill out a form with their personal information and simulate a purchase. The project includes unit tests for each requirement and a few end-to-end tests for overall testing. The project was built using components, services, mocks, and the NGXS store.
